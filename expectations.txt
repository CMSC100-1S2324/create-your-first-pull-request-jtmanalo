My thoughts about CMSC 100

I entered the classroom knowing nothing but the fact that CMSC 100 is about Web Programming. 
Learning that we have to utilize GitHub was exciting, but at the same time it was mortifying.
GitHub is a scary place. I have had already faced difficulties just setting it up and learning 
how the basic stuff work. Thankfully, I passed through them with others' help. I hope I 
will be able to pass through future difficulties as well.

Comments: We're in the same boat. Github is a bit overwhelming at first, but hopefully we will be able to master it in the coming weeks. Let's help each other!
